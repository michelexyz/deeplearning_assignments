#  Deep learning individual assignments
Repository for the individual assignments (1 and 2) from the Deep Learning course at the Vrije Universiteit taught by Peter Bloem, Michael Cochez and Shujian Yu.

## Assignment 1
In this assignment we worked both with syntetic data and the MNIST dataset, we had to:
- Implement a small neural network from scratch, using only Python's Math package, reporting our math derivation for the derivatives.
- Vectorize the forward and backward operatrions for the above using the numpy package.
- Allow for processing in batches (batched gradient descent).
- Test our final model on the MNIST dataset and report the results

Grade: 9/10

## Assignment 2
In this assignment we focused on how an autograd library is implemented through the vugrad educational library and PyTorch.
More specifically we had to:
- Provide the mathematical derivation of the vectorized forward and backward pass for different matrix operations.
- Explain and implement part of the necessary steps and components of an autograd library software architecture.
- Fine-tune the parameters of the network and test it on the MNIST-dataset
- Implent another NN classifier with PyTorch, fine-tune and test it on the image dataset CIFAR10.

Grade: 8/10
